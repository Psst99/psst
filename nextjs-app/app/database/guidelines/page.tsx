          For several years now, PSST MLLE has been collecting names of MaGe
          (Marginalised Genders: women and marginalised gender identities and
          expressions) artists on a document. Initially intended for internal
          use, we realised that it would be useful to share it and make it
          available to everyone.

          With this database, we intend to create a tool to not only connect
          with each other and strengthen our communities, but also to make this
          unity visible outside of our circles, answering once and for all to
          the mainstream scenes’ argument that we are not numerous or visible
          enough.

          This database aims to bring together MaGe artists in the Belgian music
          scene and the various sectors that revolve around it. So far, the main
          categories are DJ, producer, live artist, scenography,
          technician, safety and collective. But we expect these to grow and
          evolve thanks to your contributions.
        </p>
        <p className='mt-4 text-base leading-tight md:text-2xl'>
          On that note, this database is a work in progress and the website will
          keep evolving and improving. Feel free to send your feedback
          to database@psstmlle.space.

        <p className='mt-16 text-2xl md:text-3xl'>How to browse and search?</p>
        <p className='mt-4 text-base leading-tight md:text-2xl'>
          You can BROWSE by clicking on the main categories stated above. A list
          of names will show up. You can then click on each profile in order to
          check out their bio, websites, socials, sometimes their email
          addresses or any other useful link. To SEARCH, you can type in a music
          genre, a category, a specific job, or even the name of an artist and
          the list will narrow down to show exclusively the results which
          contain your search.
